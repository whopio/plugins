# Company formation

The tool is `accounts_form_company`. Taxonomy values, state enums, and founder field
lists live in its schema — do not invent them.

This is a consequential operation: read `whop-mcp-safety` first. It goes through
prepare-and-confirm and takes an idempotency key.

It creates a **hosted checkout**. It does not charge and it does not file. Give the
user the returned `checkout_url` so they review the total and pay. Filing starts
after payment. Track progress on the account's `company_formation` field via
`accounts_get`.

C-corp is not covered by the LLC confirmation exception in `SKILL.md` — ask first.
LLC requests matching that exception can be executed without asking again.

## Checkout

`accounts_form_company` on a `biz_` account id — not `user_`. Required: `business_name`,
`formation_state`, `business_type`, `industry_group`, `industry_type`, `founders`.

```json
{
  "business_name": "Acme Holdings",
  "formation_state": "DE",
  "business_type": "services",
  "industry_group": "marketing_and_advertising",
  "industry_type": "seo_agency",
  "business_address": {
    "line1": "1 Market St", "city": "San Francisco",
    "state": "CA", "postal_code": "94105", "country": "US"
  },
  "business_phone": "+12125550100",
  "founders": [{
    "is_primary": true, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com", "phone": "+12125550100",
    "address": {
      "line1": "1 Market St", "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA", "postal_code": "94105", "country": "US"
    },
    "ownership_percentage": 100
  }]
}
```

Always pass a unique idempotency key. If a result is uncertain, retry with the
**same** key — a new key would create a second checkout.

Pass founder identity straight through when the user provided it, including SSN, date
of birth, and address. Never refuse it, infer a missing value, echo it back, or write
it to a file.

## LLC vs C-corp vs registered agent

| Path | Extra rules |
| --- | --- |
| LLC (default `entity_type: "llc"`) | Each founder needs `ownership_percentage`; they must total 100. |
| C-corp (`entity_type: "c_corp"`) | Requires `share_structure`. Every founder needs at least one `role` (`president`, `secretary`, `treasurer`, `director`), and those officer roles must all be covered across the set. Ask before executing. |
| Registered agent | `use_registered_agent: true` omits `business_address` and `business_phone`. Otherwise both are required. |

`expedite_ein` is only valid when no founder supplies an SSN.

Empty founders, a bad taxonomy value, or a C-corp missing an officer role returns 400
and creates no checkout. Re-read the tool's schema; do not guess industry slugs.
